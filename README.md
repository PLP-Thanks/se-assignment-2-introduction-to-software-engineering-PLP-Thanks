Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
-----This is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods for the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
-----This is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods for the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the use of a sequential software development life cycle to create software applications. Unlike for traditional programming where programs are mannually created that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output.ie program + input = output.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
----- Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
      Requirements: It involves identifying and recording the needs of the final user by conducting interviews, surveys and focus groups to understand the user's expectations and needs. These efforts results in a Requirements Specification Document which outlines the software's purpose, features and functionalities acting as a guide the development team and providing cost estimates if needed.
      Design: It involves the building framework of the entire software's structure, navigation, user interface and database design. This ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs tasks efficiently. The culmination of these tasks is an exhaustive software design development (SDD) which provides a roadmap for the building team during the coding phase.
      Testing: This is the stringent quality inspection of the production line. It involves thorough examination of the software for any bugs. The aim of this phase is to ensure software's robustness, reliability and flawness of the software operation before it reaches the end users.
      Deployment: It involves rolling out the meticulously tested software to its end-users, it signifies shift from the project phase to a product phase to fulfill its purpose.
      Maintenance: It is characterized by constant assitance and improvement of the software system. It guarantees the software's functionality and longevity ensuring it meets the client's expectations and needs.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
----- The agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. It has a collaborative and cross-functional approach to planning, analysis, design and delivery. It allows companies to develop and release software changesin small segments on a frequent basis.
----- The waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving to the next step. The phase includes following requirements;-requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintenance. This phase is similar to the direction water flows over the edge of a cliff. Waterfall projects have a high degree of process definition with little or no output variability. The waterfall model is a good choice if the project is constrained by cost and time. 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
----- Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the needs and expectations of stakehlders for the software system.
----- Process 
      Feasibilty study. It analyzes the technical skills and capabilities of the technical team whether the existing technology can be used or not, provides the degree of how easy the product will operate and maintain after deployment and finally it studies the cost and benefit of the project.

      Requirements Elicitation. This is the process of gathering information about the needs expectationsof the stakeholders for the software system. It is aimed towards understanding the intent for software, needs and expectations of the stakeholders. Some of the techniques employed here include interviews, surveys, focus groups, observation and prototyping.

      Requirements specifications. This is process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent and unambiguous manner. It involves prioritizing and grouping the requirements into manageable chunks by use of ER (Entity Relationship) diagrams, DFDs (Data Flow Diagrams), FDDs (Function Decomposition Diagrams) and data dictionaries to effectively communicate requirements. It is aimed to create a clear and comprehensive document that describes the requirements of the software system.

      Requirements verification and validation. This is the process of checking that the requirementsfor the system are complete, consistent, accurate and that they meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. It is aimed to ensure that te software being developed meets the requirements and that it is developed on time, within budget and its of the required quality.

      Requirements management. This is the process of managing the requirements throughout the SDCL (Software Development Life Cycle) including tracking, controlling changes and ensuring that the requirements are still valid and relevant. It is to ensure that the software meets the needs and expectations and that it is developed on time, within the specified budget and required quality. Some of the activities here include tracking and controlling changes, version control, traceability, communication, and monitoring and reporting.

----- Importance of requirements engineering include;
      Ensures the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders
      Enhances the identification of potential issues in the development process hence allowing adjustments to be made.
      Provides an unambiguous description of the requirements which helps to reduce misunderstanding and errors.
      Provides a solid foundation for the development process which helps to reduce the risk of failure.
      Ensures that the software is delivered on time, within budget and to the requied quality standards.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
----- This is the measure of how a software is decomposed into smaller pieces with standardized interfaces ie logical partitioning of a software system into small, independent and interchangeable modules. Each module is designed specifically to achieve a desired functionality. 
----- Modularity improves its maintability by easening the exercise of identifying and fixing bugs as each module is self contained and can be tested independently.
----- In scalability, modularity allows for easier addition and removal of modules, making it easier to adapt to the changing requirements

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
----- levels of software testing 
      Unit testing: This is the first level of functional testing and the primary goal is to validate the performance of the unit components. The main advantage of this testing is it ensures identifying of errors in the software which reduces software development risks and as well astime and money.

      Integration testing: This is combinatory type of testing which combines different software modules, phases and testing as a group who work seamlessly together. It involves carrying out checks on data flow between components.

      System testing: This is the checking of the system's compliance as per the requirements. It is most probably the final test to identify that the system meets the specification, criteria and it evaluates both the functional and non-functional need for the testing.

      Acceptance testing: This is the highest level of testing, where the software is tested to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria specified by the end-user. It is therefore performed by the client focusing on required specifications and requirements of the software.

----- The aim of this phase is to ensure software's robustness, reliability and flawness of the software operation before it reaches the end users.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
-----version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code overtime. They help software teams work faster and smarter, reduce development time and increase successful deployments. version control systems also keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database by comparing with the earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
